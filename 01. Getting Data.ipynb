    "In several cases, we have access to historical data about the behavior of the complex system that we want to model. This was the case for [Google a few years ago](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/42542.pdf) and [led to considerable energy savings later on](https://deepmind.com/blog/deepmind-ai-reduces-google-data-centre-cooling-bill-40/).\n",

    "In our case, unfortunately (?!?) historical data about zombie virus outbreaks are not available. This tends to happen when the scenario that we need to deal with is somthing that really shoudl not happen, such as an expensive machine breaking or the downfall of humanity.\n",

    "Just to given an intuition of how the simulator (configured for our needs) works:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The nodes of the network will be our lab workers, which can be healthy or infected\n",
    "* The arcs represent encounters, which arise and disappear randomly\n",
    "* For every enconters, there may be several interactions\n",
    "* Each interaction with an infected (e.g. an attack) may lead to infection\n",
    "* At each step, some of the workers (healthy and infected) may die\n",
    "* At each step, some of the infected may recover\n",
    "\n",
    "More in detail, the simlator is controlled by six parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `edge.ratio`, representing the average fraction of the maximum number of edges that is present in the network at each step\n",
    "* `act.rate`, i.e. the average number of interactions per edge\n",
    "* `inf.prob`, i.e. the infection probability per interaction\n",
    "* `ds.rate`, i.e. is the mortality rate for healty workers\n",
    "* `di.rate`, i.e. is the mortality rate for the infected\n",
    "* `rec.rate`, i.e. the recovery rate\n",
    "\n",
    "We will run the simulator for one week with a population of 500 individual and a single initial infection case.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main outputs are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The final number of healty (susceptible or recovered) individuals (i.e. the survivors)\n",
    "* The final number of infected\n",
    "\n",
    "The process is stochastic, so different runs may lead to different results.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to realize that **the simulator inputs are not the same as the decisions in out optimization problem**. They represent instead *features* that describe the target system."
