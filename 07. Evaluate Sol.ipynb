    "1. The ML model is handled by an optimization solver, which my end up finding a \"weak spot\" in the approximation, e.g. an input configuration for which the prediction is particularly off.\n",
    "2. Sometimes, the most typical task specification in Machine Learning are not the best suited once the ML model is handled by a solver.\n",
